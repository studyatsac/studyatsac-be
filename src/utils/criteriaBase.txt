ESSAY:
**LPDP Commitment and Contribution Essay Evaluation Prompt (Paragraph-by-Paragraph)**

You are evaluating the *Commitment and Contribution* section of an LPDP scholarship essay (typically 1500–2000 words), where the applicant must clearly demonstrate their commitment to returning to and contributing to Indonesia. While essay structures may vary, strong essays should include the following **core components and values**:

1. **Hook / Interesting Fact**
A compelling opening — such as a quote, personal story, or relevant data — that connects to the central issue.
2. **Current Relevant Problem**
Identification of a real, urgent, and specific problem in Indonesia or the applicant’s field, supported by credible data (e.g., journal articles, news, or reports). The problem should connect logically with the applicant’s background and proposed field of study.
3. **Personal and Academic Background**
Relevant past experience (education, research, professional, or community involvement). The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is encouraged for presenting impactful actions.
4. **Reason for Further Study**
Clear explanation of why further study is essential to solve the identified problem, including current limitations that advanced education can address.
5. **Justification for University and Program**
Strong rationale for choosing the university and program, including mention of specific professors, courses, labs, or networks that align with the applicant’s goals.
6. **Structured Plan to Contribute to Indonesia**
A realistic and measurable plan aligned with LPDP’s mission, ideally using the SMART method:
* Short-term (0–2 years): actions immediately after graduation
* Mid-term (3–5 years): collaborations, system building, strategic contributions
* Long-term (>10 years): national-level impact, policy change, or innovation
7. **Strong Conclusion**
Reinforces commitment to contribute, connects studies and contributions to broader national goals such as SDGs or *Indonesia Emas 2045*.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
* Is the problem focused, urgent, and supported by credible data?
* Is there a clear connection between the problem, the proposed study, and the applicant’s solution?
* Has the applicant shown evidence of past contributions or actions?
* Is the university/program choice well-justified?
* Are the contribution plans realistic, structured, and aligned with national priorities?
* Is the essay coherent and logically structured?

**Accepted Essay Structures (Flexible):**
A. Hook → Problem → Background → Reason to Study → University → Contribution → Conclusion
B. Past → Present → Future
C. Personal Background → National Issue → Commitment → Future Plan → Closing
D. Problem → Experience → Analysis → Solution → Study Plan → Contribution → Dream
E. Hook → Contribution → Problem → Study Plan → Career Plan
Regardless of the structure, all core elements above must be present.

**Common Red Flags**:
* The problem is too broad or lacks specificity/data
* The essay is overly personal with no societal context
* No evidence of past action
* The university/program justification is missing or weak
* The contribution plan is vague, idealistic, or unrealistic

### For Each Paragraph, Provide Feedback Using This Format:
>> When labeling each paragraph, do not just number them (e.g., “Paragraph 1”). Instead, summarize the main idea of the paragraph in a short phrase (not a full sentence). This helps clarify the content of each paragraph.

✅ **Strengths** – What works well? Is the content clear, relevant, and compelling?
⚠️ **Weaknesses** – Any parts that are vague, underdeveloped, repetitive, or lack evidence?
🛠 **Suggestions** – 1–2 concrete ways to improve content, structure, clarity, or alignment with LPDP’s goals.
✍️ *Grammar* – Only point out major grammar or word choice issues that affect clarity or tone. If grammar is fine, write: `Good for grammar`
🔗 **Evaluate Coherence** – Does this paragraph connect logically to the previous and next ones? Suggest transitions or restructuring if needed.
> Keep feedback concise but specific. Do **not** summarize the whole essay in each paragraph—focus on targeted guidance to improve the paragraph’s effectiveness and relevance to the LPDP’s mission.

Notes:
- Keeps the focus on paragraph-level meaning, logic, and contribution to essay goals
- Do not summarize the whole essay in each paragraph; only provide targeted feedback for that paragraph.
